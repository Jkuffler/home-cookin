  <h4>My love for grilled cheese. . .</h4>
<p>
  I learned about Grilled Cheese like most people. I ate some when a grown up made it for me. My Mom’s grilled cheese was prepared with a searing hot pan, butter on the bread, and a couple slices of Velveeta that were rolled off the family-sized brick you can still get. Make sure you use the rollie-Velveeta-cutter-blicky-thingumajig. Not bad. Oh- or just buy the pre-sliced. Anyway that super-hot pan would leave my childish pallet wanting for flavor. At the time I just didn’t want any of the butter burnt up. My kid brain just knew that burnt was yucky.

  I got some kinda sick one summer. My aunt was watching my brother and I plus her two boys. I was trying Aunt Stacey’s grilled cheese for the first time that I can ever recall. We usually had PBJ - being sick meant it was time to try another classic. I remember being left with the impression (or simply being told) that when I ate the grilled cheese I would likely feel better. I took this to mean that I’m essentially going to be eating my medicine.
</p>

<p>
  From the first bite I began an analysis. I sorta picture my brain rewiring its definition for Grilled Cheese to now represent something of deeper substance and value. Was this salted butter? Kraft? Wonder bread? Hey check that out I feel better!
</p>

<p>
  Golden crunchy flakes were giving way to a soft center of bread and melted, individually-wrapped slices of some kinda yellow gold.

  I can still feel myself taking a new regard for the Grilled Cheese. This one was a color like you might see in a commercial. Was the cheese not Velveeta? Certainly not artisan or deli style. Definitely processed. I’d like to know for sure. My cousins don't remember. 
</p>

<p>So any chance I got I was making my own Grilled Cheese. Even for other kids in the family - like my cousins and brother</p>

<p>Maybe a total of 10 other people have had a Grilled Cheese sandwich I personally prepped for ‘em. Just typing that feels like a problem I should address.</p>

<p>If my butter is too cool I’m likely going to allow the chip of butter start to fry in the medium heated pan. I would rather slather the butter on into a smooth layer of buttery gloss. Back when I would use Gramma’s kitchen I used some sorta steel pan and an electric range. These are not easy conditions for any food. That environment was the training weights to my development as Grilled Cheese snob. In those cases when I cooked for family I preferred using thoroughly room-temp butter. Shiny bread is grills perfectly well so long as you’re mindful of the temp & time. During the grilling I’m essentially bonded with the pan/stove. Early in life I didn’t realize the importance of salted butter. We’re calling this early years of using whatever Gramma had: unsalted butter. I’m not even sure I was 10 when I got compliments from the family. Time and again I got enthusiastic approval of my 2 cousins. “This is better than our moms!”. It was different in two ways. Velveeta is the superior flavor product and with the rollie-cheese-block-cutter-blicky you’re able to portion out a more hearty amount of liquid yellow gold. Consider also the bread. For whatever reason it turns out some kids are more partial to a store-brand bread for their Grilled Cheese. Maybe though the novelty of having a contemporary make the thing without asking an adult was really the cause of the excitement. Did I ask? I don’t remember getting permission. No apologies necessary. I also washed the dishes so... No harm no foul, right?</p>

<p>Here I am pushin’ 40 (the new 50!!) and I’m ‘bout ready to cook a Grilled Cheese in my sleep. It’s the fancy double wrapped bread, a whopping 15 Grain assortment presenting a slightly more challenging read in terms of grilled appearances. Nowadays I've got an automatic dishwasher. Other transformations to my Grilled Cheese lab include the gas stove and cast-iron pan! I’m using salted butter as if I truly don’t care about heart disease. I quit alcohol in 2016: only to find more space for these types of simple, delicate pleasures. Blood pressure be damned.</p>

<p>Oh Grilled Cheese! On the outside you sing to me a promise, a prayer, or a whispered secret. You fulfill your promise, I answer your prayer, we are giggling as I chew through crusted dough and still warm golden delicious caloric wonder. There is often soup: tomato, or black bean - can't go wrong. </p>

<p>What was that about Eggs? Did he even bring up coffee? Let's hang out one lovely day and make chocolate chip cookies the size of our face. It’s another blurb all together; however, for now I have one more bit to add. Of all the ways to prep all the ingredients I might ever use I’ll stick to what I’ve loved longest of all. I’m no chef. I’m just a dude who loves process and artistry - always learning how to learn. Without the Grilled Cheese I’m less likely to have quickly gained skills and the ability to froth 32 oz of any kind of dairy milk, prepped up to bona-fide Italian standards all for a wide variety of random e-bar hot beverages. My coffee ninjas know what’s up. </p>

<p>Without curiosity we are starved. Stay hungry for knowledge. You prolly gonna burn somethin' to learn somethin'.
