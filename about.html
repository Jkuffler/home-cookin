    <p>have you tried <strong>tunafish and spaghetti</strong> yet? If so, did you make it using tomato juice for your spaghetti sauce? If so, was your favorite part of this meal the side dish: oven-toasted garlic bread? I'm talking about white bread, oven toasted, with butter and garlic salt.</p>
    <p>it's not so bad, really. gotta say though: having tunafish and spaghetti <em>very regularly</em> throughout my formative years left me with a firm resolve to provide more flavor from my own kitchen</p>
    <p>this is my love letter to food. recipes and stories when and where applicable. check back. stop by. i made enough to share!</p>
